## 🎯 Theme: _What if the ocean were a human body?_

The challenge: imagine an analogy between the ocean's functioning and the human body to raise awareness about its preservation.

## 💡 Our Experience

It was our first Nuit de l'Info, and the challenge was huge: **we didn't know JavaScript!**
We had to learn on the fly throughout the night to bring our project to life.

The result is an interactive site where the user must "heal" Atlantis, the personification of the ocean, by interacting with its organs (heart, lungs, etc.) which represent different aspects of the marine ecosystem.
