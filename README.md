# 🌙 My Nuit de l'Info Participations

Welcome to the repository gathering my participations in the **Nuit de l'Info**.

## ❓ What is the Nuit de l'Info?

The Nuit de l'Info (Night of Computer Science) is a national competition that brings together students, teachers, and companies to work together on developing a web application. The challenge? An entire night, from sunset to sunrise, to solve computing challenges based on a given theme.

## 📅 2025 Edition: The Resistant Digital Village

For this second participation, we had gained much more experience and technical knowledge. This allowed us to create a much more qualitative and ambitious project, and it was super cool to do!

The concept: a duality between the hell of Windows 10 (planned obsolescence) and the Linux paradise (sustainable alternative).

## 📅 2024 Edition: What if the ocean were a human body?

This was our very first participation! At the time, we were still beginners in JavaScript and had to learn on the fly throughout the night. Despite the challenge, we managed to produce an interactive site.
