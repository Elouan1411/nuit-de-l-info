## 🎯 Theme: *The Resistant Digital Village*

The theme was revealed to us at sunset. The challenge in one sentence:

> **How can schools free themselves from Big Tech dependency and fight planned obsolescence by adopting an Inclusive, Responsible, and Sustainable Digital approach (NIRD)?**

---

## 💡 Our Concept: *“The End of Windows 10 vs. The Linux Renaissance”*

To address this serious topic with humor and interactivity, we designed a two-phase experience:

---

### 1️⃣ Windows 10 Hell — *(Planned Obsolescence)*

The user lands on a Windows 10 desktop simulator… in total decay:

- 🖥️ **Buggy Interface**: Blue screens, laggy windows, random system errors.  
- 📂 **Broken File Sharing**: Impossible to delete files, and no preview available.  
- 🤖 **Useless Chatbot**: A depressed Clippy that provides irrelevant answers.  
- 📉 **Frustrating UX**: Representing the dead-end of closed ecosystems.

💾 The only way out?  
A big icon on the desktop: **INSTALL LINUX**.

---

### 2️⃣ Linux Paradise — *(The NIRD Alternative)*

Clicking the icon triggers an installation sequence and switches the user to a clean, functional Linux environment:

- ✨ **Smooth & Elegant UI**  
- 📂 **Fully Working File Sharing** — delete files, preview them instantly  
- 🚀 **Better Performance** even on older hardware  
- 🧠 **Helpful Chatbot** with relevant answers  

---

## 🏆 Completed Challenges

We integrated a variety of technical and fun challenges during the night:

- 🐍 **Hidden Snake (Easter Egg)**  
  A snake game hidden somewhere in the Linux environment.

- 🤖 **Bipolar AI**  
  A chatbot coded to be useless on Windows and genuinely helpful on Linux.

- 🌊 **Audio Visualizer**  
  A music-reactive wave animation.

- 🧱 **Retro Brick Breaker Game**  
  An Arkanoid-style browser game.

- 📂 **Shared Folder Challenge — Windows Hell vs Linux Heaven**  
  A shared folder system designed to highlight ecosystem differences:  
  - On **Windows**:  
    - ❌ You cannot delete files  
    - ❌ No file preview  
    - ❌ Interaction errors  
  - On **Linux**:  
    - ✅ File deletion works perfectly  
    - ✅ Preview images/documents instantly  
    - ✅ Smooth and reliable user experience  
  A concrete demonstration of how open-source platforms empower users and extend hardware lifespan.
